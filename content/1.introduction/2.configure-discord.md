# Configure Discord

Truspondr expects a certain format for roleplays. The format works in the way shown below:

While Truspondr does in theory support multiple servers, it is not designed for it and may cause performance issues.

Roleplays that are per server **are not** supported. Truspondr channel management eliminates this by dynamically adding and hiding channels using Discords community features.

## Setting Up Your Server

Before beginning, you will need to have either owner or administrator privilages within the Discord server(s) you plan on using. Truspondr checks this to prevent abuse, as well as to make sure you have the ability to set the correct permissions and settings up for Truspondr to work.

Make sure you have talked with the other people you are roleplaying with and make sure that they are ok with you adding Truspondr. It fully takes over any system you may have been using previously, and while it is simple to use, it will likely require some time for people to get used to.

Adding Truspondr will also mean locking down channels for a period of time to allow Truspondr to take an inital snapshot of your server, as well as backup all characters and messages. Please make sure everyone is told about this beforehand and has no objections.

Truspondr also supports delaying system transfer until a time that suits everyone. Simply stop before you run the `trus:transfer` command in your console, and Truspondr will never start any of its processes.

To start, go through your roleplays and make sure the following is true. If you are setting up a brand new server, you can skip this:

::list
- There is 1 roleplay per category
- There is at least 1 main "chatting" channel
- Everyone has listed main characters in a channel
- You have a list of prefixes that people used for characters (if using a bot such as Tupperbox)
::

Assuming all of the previous is ok, head to your server settings and make sure you enable community features for your servr. This is what makes the channel managment and roleplay signup work properly.

## Get Credentials

Goto [discord.dev](https://discord.dev) and create a new application. We recommend creating a specific team for your bot, as it can be helpful to keep things organised when adding the live activity SDK as it classified as a seperate application from Discord.

Goto the "Bot" tab and generate a new token and write it down somewhere, you'll need it later.

Then goto the OAuth2 tab and generate a new client secret, and note thst and the client id down somewhere.

You can go back to the About tab and change the name of the bot, add a logo and a banner if you wish.
